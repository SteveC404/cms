I want you to create a client management system for me using node js with express web server and a mssql database.

The application will contain records for users who can login and use the system and separately clients.

Properties of users include:
Id
First Name
Last Name
Email
Photo
Active
Comments
Password
CreatedBy
CreatedDate
UpdatedBy
UpdatedDate

Id should be automatically generated by the database and used an a unique key start at 1.
Photo will be an image file.
Active is a boolean. If set to false then that user should be denied login to the system with an error message saying their account has been disabled.
Comments is a free text field.
Password should be stored as a hash.
CreatedBy is the Email of the user who created the entry.
CreatedDate is the datetime stamp of when that record was originally created.
UpdatedBy is the Email of the user who updated the entry.
UpdatedDate is the datetime stamp of when that record was last changed.

The initial user to setup will be:
First Name: admin
Last Name: admin
Email: admin@home
Active: true
Comments: Initial user
Password: admin

Properties of clients include:
Id
First Name
Last Name
Email
Photo
Active
Comments
Password
CreatedBy
CreatedDate
UpdatedBy
UpdatedDate

Also include any other typical client demographic details used by other client management systems.

Id should be automatically generated by the database and used an a unique key start at 1.
Photo will be an image file.
Active is a boolean. If set to false then that user should be denied login to the system with an error message saying their account has been disabled.
Comments is a free text field.
Password should be stored as a hash.
CreatedBy is the Email of the user who created the entry.
CreatedDate is the datetime stamp of when that record was originally created.
UpdatedBy is the Email of the user who updated the entry.
UpdatedDate is the datetime stamp of when that record was last changed.

At the home screen users should be prompted to login using the Email and Password.
If a user has a blank password they should be prompted to create a new password. The new password should be entered 2 times to make sure they match.

When the user logs in, they should be presented with a screen that has a header which shows their full name as a link and a thumbnail of their photo. If there is no photo in the user record, show a grey background a white capital initials of the First Name and Last Name. When they click that link they should be taken to a profile page showing their own details. That page should also allow them to change and save their details, including changing their password or upload a new photo. To change their password they should be asked to enter their new password 2 times and make sure they match before allowing the user to save changes.

The main body of the screen when a user logs in should have 2 tabs.

1. A Clients tab that shows a list of all clients in the system including the properties: Id, Last Name, First Name, Email, Active.
   The list should be able to be sorted or filtered by any of those properties.
   There should be an edit icon next to each record.
   When the edit icon is clicked that should open a pop-up screen titled Client Details showing all details of the client. Client details should be editable except for Id, CreatedBy, CreatedDate, UpdatedBy and UpdatedDate. If there is no photo in the record, show a grey background a white capital initials of the First Name and Last Name. There should be an option to upload a new photo. There should be a Close button that will close that window without saving changes. If any changes were made the user should be asked if they want to save the changes before closing with Yes No buttons. If the user clicks Yes then the updates should be saved. If the user clicks No then the window should be closed without saving. The window should also have a Save button that will save any changes and keep the Client Details window open.

Also in the Clients tab there should be a 'New Client' button. Clicking this button will show a pop-up Client Details window allowing a user to fill in all client properties except for system generated properties of Id, CreatedBy, CreatedDate, UpdatedBy and UpdatedDate.

2. A Users tab that shows a list of all users in the system including the properties: Id, Last Name, First Name, Email, Active.
   The list should be able to be sorted or filtered by any of those properties.
   There should be an edit icon next to each record.
   When the edit icon is clicked that should open a pop-up screen titled User Details showing all details of the user. User details should be editable except for Id, CreatedBy, CreatedDate, UpdatedBy and UpdatedDate. If there is no photo in the record, show a grey background a white capital initials of the First Name and Last Name. There should be an option to upload a new photo. There should be a Close button that will close that window without saving changes. If any changes were made the user should be asked if they want to save the changes before closing with Yes No buttons. If the user clicks Yes then the updates should be saved. If the user clicks No then the window should be closed without saving. The window should also have a Save button that will save any changes and keep the Client Details window open.

Also in the Clients tab there should be a 'New Client' button. Clicking this button will show a pop-up Client Details window allowing a user to fill in all client properties except for system generated properties of Id, CreatedBy, CreatedDate, UpdatedBy and UpdatedDate.

I need you to create the SQL script to create the database, tables and the initial user.
I also need you to store configuration settings in a separate .env file
I need you to create all Node JS files needed for deployment.
I need you to create instructions for deployment.
